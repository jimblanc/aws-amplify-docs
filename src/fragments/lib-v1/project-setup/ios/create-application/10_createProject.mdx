**Open Xcode.**  From the menu bar, select **"File -> New -> Project..."**

Select **iOS** tab, choose Application type as **App** and then click on **Next**.

 

Fill in the following for your project:
* Product Name: **MyAmplifyApp**
* Interface: **SwiftUI**
* Language: **Swift**
* **Tap `Next`**

 

After tapping Next, **select where you would like to save your project**, then **tap Create**.  In this example, you will choose: **~/Developer**
 

You should now have an empty iOS project without Amplify.
