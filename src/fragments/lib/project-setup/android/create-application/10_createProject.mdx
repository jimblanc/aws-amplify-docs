**Open Android Studio.**  Select **+ Create New Project.**

 

In **Select a Project Template**, select **Empty Activity**. Press **Next**.

 

Next, configure your project:

 - Enter *MyAmplifyApp* in the **Name** field
 - Select either *Java* or *Kotlin* from the **Language** dropdown menu
 - Select *API 24: Android 7.0 (Nougat)* from the **Minimum SDK** dropdown menu
 - Press **Finish**

 

Android Studio will open your project with a tab opened to either *MainActivity.java* or *MainActivity.kt* depending upon if you created a Java or Kotlin project respectively.

 

You now have an empty Android project into which you'll add Amplify in the next steps.
