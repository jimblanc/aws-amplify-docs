{/* "...configure an AWS profile locally for use with Amplify" -> `amplify configure profile` */}
This guide will walk you through how to set up your AWS account and configure an AWS profile locally for use with Amplify. Before getting started it is important to know there are a few options for authenticating with AWS. Using [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) you can configure either:

- permanent credentials with an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) through the use of access keys
- temporary credentials with [IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html), which is formerly known as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)

Temporary credentials are an alternative to their permanent counterpart that enable you to define permissions for a _session_. Sessions are created when you [_assume_ an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html) or sign in using AWS IAM Identity Center. These sessions come with an additional "session token" that is used to validate the temporary credentials and must be included on requests to AWS. As you are working locally, this will be presented as an additional environment variable.

> You can use temporary security credentials to make programmatic requests for AWS resources using the AWS CLI or AWS API (using the AWS SDKs). The temporary credentials provide the same permissions as long-term security credentials, such as IAM user credentials. However, there are a few differences:...

> [AWS Identity and Access Management documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html)

In general, though, credentials are typically resolved through the use of [AWS profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-using-profiles). Profiles can contain permanent credentials or SSO metadata, and can be set for use with Amplify by using the same techniques as the AWS CLI:

- with the `--profile` flag
- with the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable

## Configure an IAM user

To get started configuring an AWS profile with an IAM user and permanent credentials, run the following command:

```bash
npx amplify configure profile --name <value>
```

This command will ask you if you have already configured IAM user credentials. Enter `No`. To set up an IAM user with permanent credentials, follow the instructions outlined below:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to the [IAM User creation page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create)
3. Specify a user name and select **Next**. You can name the user anything but we will call it "amplify-dev"

   

4. Select **Attach policies directly** and select **AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess** as the Permissions policy

   

5. Select **Next**
6. On the Review page, check that everything looks good and select **Create user**

   

7. This will redirect to the _Users_ list page. Select the user you just created

   

8. On the user details page, navigate to the **Security credentials** tab, scroll down to **Access keys** and select **Create access keys**

   

9. On the next page, select **Command Line Interface**, acknowledge the warning, and select **Next**.

   

10. On the next page select **Create access key**. You will then see a page with the access keys for the user. Use the copy icon to copy these values to your clipboard, then return to the CLI

   

11. Next, enter the credentials of the newly created IAM user, including the access key, secret access key, and lastly select the AWS region to use with the profile.

  {/* @TODO replace this image with one that calls the profile `amplify-dev` */}
   

## Configure IAM Identity Center

This guide will walk you through setting up IAM Identity Center with [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html), which will enable you to define users, groups, permission sets, and more for your team. AWS Organizations can grow to house multiple AWS accounts, and users within the organization can traverse the AWS account(s) as their permission set allows. It is recommended to define individual organization users for each team member, however for the sake of the guide we will be using the `amplify-admin` name.

<Callout info>

The information presented below can also be found on the [official AWS documentation for IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

</Callout>

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to the [IAM Identity Center page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/home)

   

3. Select **Enable**

   

4. A dialog will open and prompt for "how you would like to configure IAM Identity Center in your AWS environment", choose "AWS Organizations" and select **Continue**

   

5. After the AWS Organization is created and IAM Identity Center is enabled you are presented with a dashboard. In the navigation pane, select **Permission sets**

   

6. Select **Create permission set**
7. When prompted for the permission set type, choose **Custom permission set**. Then select **Next**
8. Expand **AWS Managed Policies (set)** and search for _amplify_. Check **AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess** and select **Next**

   

8. Name the permission set "AmplifySet" and optionally change the session duration. Select **Next**

   

9. Review the permission set and select **Create**
10. After creation you are navigated back to the IAM Identity Center dashboard and are ready to create your first user. Using the navigation pane, select **Users**
11. Enter the user details, then select **Next**

   

12. Optionally create and add the user to a group, select **Next**
13. Review the user information and select **Add user**. The user will then need to verify their email using the email specified during user creation.
14. After user creation you are navigated back to the IAM Identity Center dashboard and are ready to assign the newly-created user to have access to an AWS account. For the sake of the demo we will use the AWS account we used to create the Organization, however you can create a new AWS account under your organization for use with Amplify. Check the management AWS account and select **Assign users or groups**

   

15. When prompted to assign a user or group, select the **Users** tab, check the user created in step 13, and select **Next**
  
   

16. Assign the permission set created in step 9 and select **Next**
17. Review the assignment information and select **Submit**
18. Now you are ready to sign in to the access portal! Navigate back to the IAM Identity Center dashboard. Within the "Settings summary" pane, copy the URL for your "AWS access portal URL"

   

19. Navigate to the copied URL and sign in as your user, "amplify-admin". After signing in you should see you have access to an AWS account and are ready to get started!

   

20. Back in your terminal, you are ready to configure an AWS profile that uses the SSO user. There are a few options for [getting IAM Identity Center user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtogetcredentials.html), however we will use the AWS CLI configuration wizard. In your terminal, run `aws configure sso`

<Callout info>

**Note**: this command is using the AWS CLI, not the Amplify CLI. [Learn how to install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

</Callout>

```console title="Terminal"
> aws configure sso
SSO session name (Recommended): amplify-admin
SSO start URL [None]: https://xxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start#
SSO region [None]: us-east-2
SSO registration scopes [sso:account:access]: <leave blank>
Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your default browser.
If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to authorize this request, open the following URL:

https://device.sso.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/

Then enter the code:

SOME-CODE
The only AWS account available to you is: <your-aws-account-id>
Using the account ID <your-aws-account-id>
The only role available to you is: AdministratorAccess
Using the role name "AdministratorAccess"
CLI default client Region [us-east-1]: us-east-2
CLI default output format [None]:
CLI profile name [AdministratorAccess-<your-aws-account-id>]: sso-amplify-admin

To use this profile, specify the profile name using --profile, as shown:

aws s3 ls --profile sso-amplify-admin
```

If you inspect `~/.aws/config` you should now see the SSO profile:

```ini title="~/.aws/config"
[profile sso-amplify-admin]
sso_session = amplify-admin
sso_account_id = <your-aws-account-id>
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-east-2
[sso-session amplify-admin]
sso_start_url = https://xxxxxx.awsapps.com/start#
sso_region = us-east-2
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

Now you are ready to use the AWS profile with single sign-on with the Amplify CLI by using the `--profile` option:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx amplify sandbox --profile sso-amplify-admin
```

Or the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable:

```bash title="Terminal"
AWS_PROFILE=sso-amplify-admin npx amplify sandbox
```

## Bootstrapping AWS account

Before you can start creating the cloud sandbox environment, Amplify will need to complete a one-time bootstrap setup for the account and region before it can start deploying resources.

<Accordion title="What is bootstrapping?" eyebrow="Learn more">

Bootstrapping is the process of provisioning resources for the AWS CDK before you can deploy AWS CDK apps into an AWS environment. These resources include an Amazon S3 bucket for storing files and IAM roles that grant permissions needed to perform deployments. The required resources are defined in an AWS CloudFormation stack, called the bootstrap stack, which is usually named `CDKToolkit`. Like any AWS CloudFormation stack, it appears in the AWS CloudFormation console once it is deployed. You can learn more about this process in the [CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html).

</Accordion>

You can set up distinct profiles for each developer on your team and they can now start developing their fullstack applications locally by creating an isolated sandbox environment as follows:

```bash
npx amplify sandbox --profile <value>
```

 

During the first time setup, `amplify sandbox` will ask you to sign into the AWS Console. Once you're signed in, you will be redirected to the Amplify Console. Select **Initialize setup now**.

 

It may take a few minutes for the bootstrapping process to complete.

 

 

Done! You have successfully completed the bootstrapping process and you can now return to the terminal to create a new Amplify Sandbox environment:

```bash
npx amplify sandbox --profile <value>
```
